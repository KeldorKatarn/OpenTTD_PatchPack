### v1.22.0 (2018-04-20)

* Add button to auto group of vehicles to the vehicle list window
* Make it possible to replace an old vehicle with the same model in the vehicle replacement window.
* Add the "all railtypes" option to train template replacement window.
* Make area-drag-placing of single-tile NewGRF objects and buying land possible.
* Daylength setting can no longer be changed after game start.
* Change the way "Send to Depot/Servicing" works. Now vehicles will prefer a depot on their order list to just any vehicle. Vehicles will go directly to that depot now and then restart their orders list from that very depot. Trains may have difficulties finding their depot, therefore they'll keep processing their normal orders, skipping any loading however, until they reach it. That makes sure they always find their way.
* Improve support for signals in tunnels and on bridges
* Remove the "start date" button from the timetable GUI and instead add a button that allows to transform all estimated times into timetabled ones at once.
* Reactivate subsidies for CargoDist handled cargoes.
* Removed the wait time as a parameter for the station rating and increased the importance of the units of waiting cargo instead to make large capacity vehicles roughly as efficient as multiple small capacity ones.
* Add a group membership conditional order.
* Add the lifetime profit display to the vehicle group window.
* Increase number of possible rail types from 16 to 32.
* Make sure industry build locations are found better.
* Change the train details window total cargo tab to Performance tab and added additional useful info about the length of the train, its maximum speed when empty and loaded.
* Change the window of template vehicles so they correctly show the weight of the fully loaded train (which is of most interest when creating a template).
* Always allow tunnels to cross. Height is very abstract in OpenTTD and it is also perfectly possible for a junction to be in a tunnel.
* Add station catchment button to the station GUI.
* Make it possible to change the destination of a conditional order with Ctrl-Shift-Click.
* Adjust the cargo income curves. They are more stable now and make a lot more sense.
* Vehicles no longer have a running cost when waiting in a depot.
* Add support for experimental seaplane airports and the corresponding upgraded OpenGFX Airports NewGRF
* Change the visuals of the station rating tooltip and improved the 'next stop feedback' functionality again. Now it should work perfectly.
* Several bugfixes

### v1.12.0 (2016-01-13)
* Add a detailed station rating tool tip for each cargo in the station window.
* Change the way punishments for source stations work. That is now also displayed in the tool tip.
* Do a round robin for all accepting industries instead of only delivering to the closest one.
* Add additional conditional orders.
* Add 'Reverse at waypoint' order
* Add setting to hide track overgrowth.
* Hierarchical groups can now be collapsed
* Add train speed adaptation (trains go slower if a train in front of them is slower)

### v1.9.1 (2016-01-07)
* Improved timetable usability with several Ctrl+Click functionalities to set or clear values on all orders.
* Add 'show/hide vehicles' feature for the 'advanced build train' and 'build train template' windows.

### v1.7.0 (2016-01-07)
* Variable day length setting

* Signals in tunnels and on bridges (with support for path signals)
* Measurement tool in landscaping toolbar
* Rating in town label
* Changed tree growth. Less trees at level 1 and approaching the tree line on mountains.
* Ship collision avoidance
* Better road vehicle overtaking behavior. They now mostly ignore opposing traffic but are now capable of truly using both lanes of one way roads. (Think highways)
* Trains can no longer collide with road vehicles (reasoning behind this is that such crashes cannot be prevented.)
* Vehicle trip history window
* Unused tracks are overgrown by grass (purely visual, can be deactivated in settings)
* Make 'cargo payment rates' graph more useful by basing it on vehicle speed
* Rail fences can be hidden by a setting (In the settings dropdown)
* Taxes (a percentage of the company value) are payed by each company. This punished dead cash and rewards investment.
